            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50625:12"/>to anſwer the Deponent, You are a married Man, and ſo may know theſe Matters; The Water is broke or come away, or to that Effect; and then bid the Deponent go into the Dreſſing Room within the Bed-chamber, where the Deponent found ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons of Quality: Above Half an Hour after (to the beſt of this Deponent's Memory, all the Company in that Room were called into the Bed-chamber; The Deponent ſtood near the Bed's Feet, on the Left Side, where he heard the Queen's Groans, and preſently after ſeveral loud Skreeks; the laſt, the Deponent remembers continued ſo long, that he then wondred how any Body could hold their Breath ſo long: Preſently after, the Deponent heard them ſay the Queen was delivered; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Deponent ſtepped up to the Bed-ſide, and ſaw a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he ſuppoſes the Midwife, kneeling at the other Side of the Bed, who had her Hands and Arms within the Bed-clothes for a pretty while; then the Deponent ſaw her ſpread a Cloth upon her Lap, and laid the End of it over the Bed-clothes, and then fetch a Child (as the Deponent firmly believes, for he could not then ſee it) out of the Bed into that Cloth, and give it to Ms. <hi>Delabadie,</hi> who brought it round to the Side where the Deponent ſtood, and carried it into a little Room, into which the Deponent immediatly followed the King, and ſaw her ſit down by the Fire, and heard her ſay, It is a Boy; upon which the King ſaid, let me ſee it; whereupon ſhe laid open the Cloth, and ſhewed all the Child, ſaying, There's what you wiſh to ſee: The Deponent doth not charge his Memory with the very Words, but the Senſe of what he heard. The Deponent looked upon the Child at the ſame Time, which appeared to be very foul.

                  <p>THAT upon the Deponent's coming to viſit her Majeſty then lying at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 10 of <hi>June</hi> 1688, as the Deponent went up the Back-ſtairs, he heard the joyful Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that a Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> wsas born, upon which the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent haſtned preſently into the little Bed-chamber, where the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent found Mrs. <hi>Delabadie</hi> juſt ſitting down before the Fire, with the new born Prince wrapp'd in the Mantles, lying in her Lap. Then paſſing to the Queen in the next Bed-chamber, the Deponent congratulated the happy Birth of the Prince, and her Majeſty's ſafe Delivery. The Queen was wearied and panting, but otherwiſe in good Condition: Then the Midwife brought to the Deponent the After-birth reeking warm, which Sir <hi>Thomas Witherley,</hi> with the Deponent, examined, and found very ſound and perfect. After a while, the Deponent underſtood, that a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine was mentioned among the Ladies for a ceertain Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Convulſions: It was, ſome Drops of Blood from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel-ſtring; the Deponent conſulted Sir <hi>Thomas Witherley</hi> and the other Phyſicians; and to ſatisfy the Women, it was allowed of; there being, as was conceived, no Danger in the Thing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the Midwife, with a ſmall Knife ſtit the Navel-ſtring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Ligature, from which came ſome Drops of freſh Blood, taken in a Spoon, and given the Child, being mix'd with a ittle <hi>Black Cherry-Water.</hi> Thus much the Deponent hath to ſay upon her Majeſty's preſent Delivery.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Time of the Queen's Conception, ſhe often told the Deponent and others, That ſhe had two Reckonings; one one, from <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 6th of <hi>Sept.</hi> when the King return'd from his Progreſs to the Queen then at <hi>Bath,</hi> and the other from <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 6th of <hi>Octob.</hi> when the Queen came to the King at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor;</hi> but for ſome Reaſons, the Queen rather reckoned from the Latter; though afterwards it prov'd juſt to agree with the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Moreover, her Majeſty, when, according to her Reckoning, ſhe was gone with Child 12 Weeks, ſaid that ſhe was quick, and perceived the Child to move; the Deponent returned no Anſwer
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50625:14"/>to the Queen, but privately told thoſe about her, That in Truth, it could not ſo be in to ſhort a Time; yet the Queen was in the Right, only miſtook her Reckoning; for ſhe was then full 16 Weeks gone with Child; about which time ſhe uſually quickned with her former Children, and accordingly was brought to bed on the 10th of <hi>June,</hi> 1688, nd within Three or four Days of full forty Weeks.</p>
